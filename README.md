# Songbird Recorder

An audio recorder for the Songbird hardware platform that can record audio from computers, smart phones, and other USB audio devices.

## What it does

This device sits between your audio source and headset, recording both the USB audio input and headset microphone to an SD card while allowing normal audio playback and conversation.

## Built for Songbird Hardware

- **Microcontroller**: Teensy 4.0
- **Audio Processing**: SGTL5000 codec via Audio Shield
- **Storage**: SD card (FAT32 formatted)
- **Display**: 128x32 OLED
- **Controls**: 4 buttons
- **LEDs**: Blue (recording), Pink (playback)

## Setup

1. Insert SD card
2. Connect headset via 3.5mm jack
3. Connect audio source via USB-C cable

## Uses

- **Computer audio**: Record computer audio output + your microphone input
- **Interviews**: Record remote interviews via video calls
- **Music/Podcasts**: Record audio from any USB audio source with commentary
- **Accessibility**: Create audio records for note-taking or hearing assistance
- **Documentation**: Record important conversations for reference

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Recording audio may be subject to legal restrictions in your jurisdiction.**

### Recording Consent Requirements
- **Two-party consent states**: All parties must consent to recording (California, Florida, etc.)
- **One-party consent states**: Only the recorder needs to consent
- **International calls**: May be subject to stricter international laws
- **Workplace recording**: Often prohibited without employer consent

### User Responsibilities
- **Obtain proper consent** before recording conversations
- **Notify participants** when recording is active
- **Comply with local laws** regarding audio recording
- **Protect recorded data** from unauthorized access
- **Implement retention policies** - don't keep recordings longer than necessary

### Data Security Best Practices
- **Encrypt SD cards** when possible
- **Use strong passwords** for file access
- **Limit access** to recordings on a need-to-know basis
- **Delete recordings** when no longer needed
- **Backup responsibly** - consider encryption for cloud storage
